        AnatomyQuest is dedicated to creating comprehensive, interactive,
        image-driven anatomy resources that help students understand the big
        picture. We collaborate with underprivileged communities and use revenue

            We aim to collaborate with underprivileged communities to create
            comprehensive, interactive, image-driven information pages that help
            students see the big picture when studying anatomy. We will then use
            the revenue generated by the site to directly support those
            communities.
