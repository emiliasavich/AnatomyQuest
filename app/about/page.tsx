        AnatomyQuest is dedicated to creating comprehensive, interactive,

            We aim to collaborate with underprivileged communities to create
            comprehensive, interactive, image-driven information pages that help
            students see the big picture when studying anatomy. We will then use
            the revenue generated by the site to directly support those
            communities.

            The goal is to focus on the <em>why</em> behind anatomical
            structures, not just the <em>what</em>, to make knowledge more
            meaningful and easier to retain. For example, instead of simply
            asking{" "}
            <em>&quot;What is the greater tubercle of the humerus?&quot;</em>,
            these information pages encourage students to ask{" "}
            <em>
              &quot;Why is the greater tubercle a named structure, and what role
              does it play?&quot;
            </em>
