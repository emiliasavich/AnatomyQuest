      <p>
        We aim to collaborate with underprivileged communities to create comprehensive, interactive, image-driven information pages that help students see the big picture when studying anatomy. We will then use the revenue generated by the site to directly support those communities.
      </p>

      <h2 className="font-serif text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-stone-900 sm:text-2xl mt-6">Educational Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is to focus on the <em>why</em> behind anatomical structures, not just the <em>what</em>, to make knowledge more meaningful and easier to retain. For example, instead of simply asking <em>&quot;What is the greater tubercle of the humerus?&quot;</em>, these information pages encourage students to ask <em>&quot;Why is the greater tubercle a named structure, and what role does it play?&quot;</em>
      </p>
