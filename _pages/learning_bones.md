<h1>UNFINISHED SO PLEASE DON'T JUDGE</h1>

<div>

  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand how each bone relates to the body as a whole.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Linking a bone to the skeletal, muscular, and cardiovascular systems helps you see its function in context. This approach promotes deeper, longer-lasting learning compared to rote memorization.</p>

  <p><strong>How to use this guide:</strong> Follow the five structured steps below. They are designed to help you focus on meaningful connections rather than just memorizing facts.</p>

  <p class="mnemonic"><strong>Mnemonic:</strong> <em>Learning Small Notes About Bones</em></p>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Step 1 – Location</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which body region contains the bone?</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Identifying location helps you build a mental map of the skeleton and recall neighboring bones and muscles.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Step 2 – Shape</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the bone’s shape?</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> A bone’s shape is closely linked to its function. Recognizing the shape gives insight into the bone’s role in movement and support.</p>

    <h3>Common Shapes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Long:</strong> Acts as a lever, enabling large movements.
        <br><img src="path-to-long-bone-image.jpg" alt="Long bone example"></li>
      <li><strong>Short:</strong> Provides strength and stability with limited motion.
        <br><img src="path-to-short-bone-image.jpg" alt="Short bone example"></li>
      <li><strong>Flat:</strong> Protects organs and provides muscle attachment.
        <br><img src="path-to-flat-bone-image.jpg" alt="Flat bone example"></li>
      <li><strong>Irregular:</strong> Complex shape, specialized function.
        <br><img src="path-to-irregular-bone-image.jpg" alt="Irregular bone example"></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Step 3 – Neighbors</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which bones articulate with this one?</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Knowing neighboring bones and joint types helps you understand how this bone contributes to movement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Step 4 – Anatomical Landmarks</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the bone’s named landmarks, and what are their functions?</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Landmarks indicate where muscles and ligaments attach. Understanding their function shows why the area has its name and prepares you to study muscles more efficiently.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Step 5 – Blood Supply</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which blood vessels supply the bone?</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Studying blood supply links the skeletal and cardiovascular systems, and builds a mental map of vessels that will help in future cardiovascular studies.</p>
