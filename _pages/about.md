  <h2>Our Mission</h2>

  <p>
    We aim to collaborate with underprivileged communities to create comprehensive, interactive, image-driven information pages that help students see the big picture when studying anatomy. We will then use the revenue generated by the site to directly support those communities.
  </p>

  <h2>Educational Approach</h2>
  <p>
    The goal is to focus on the <em>why</em> behind anatomical structures, not just the <em>what</em>, to make
    knowledge more meaningful and easier to retain.
    For example, instead of simply asking
    <em>“What is the greater tubercle of the humerus?”</em>,
    these information pages encourage students to ask
    <em>“Why is the greater tubercle a named structure, and what role does it play?”</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Feedback</h2>

  <p>
    If you have suggestions for improving this website or its study sheets, please share them at
