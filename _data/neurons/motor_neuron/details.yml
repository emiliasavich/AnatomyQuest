    - name: "Cell Body (Soma)"
      description:
        - "Contains the nucleus and most organelles"
        - "Located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord (lower motor neurons) or the motor cortex (upper motor neurons)"
        - "Receives input from thousands of synaptic connections"
    - name: "Dendrites"
      description:
        - "Short, branching extensions from the cell body"

    - name: "Axon"
      description:
        - "Single long projection that carries electrical impulses away from the cell body"
        - "Can extend over one meter in length (e.g., from spinal cord to foot muscles)"
        - "Wrapped in a myelin sheath formed by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system"
    - name: "Axon Terminal (Synaptic Bouton)"
      description:
        - "Branched endings of the axon that form synapses with target cells"
        - "Contains synaptic vesicles filled with acetylcholine (at the neuromuscular junction)"
