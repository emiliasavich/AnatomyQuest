    <strong>Comprehensive note sheets that help you see the big picture.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Each study sheet on this site is designed to promote understanding rather than rote memorization.
    The goal is to focus on the <em>why</em> behind anatomical structures, not just the <em>what</em>, to make
    knowledge more meaningful and easier to retain.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, instead of simply asking
    <em>“What is the greater tubercle of the humerus?”</em>,
    these sheets encourage you to ask
    <em>“Why is the greater tubercle a named structure, and what role does it play?”</em>
  </p>
